Changed features, from a player's perspective.

* Modules now have dynamic ids. This means that the id of modules may change between worlds, but are constant within the same world. Given this new system other mods may register new modules as well without having any issues with other mods also registering new modules. The change to how modules are loaded also means that the modules listed in the creative window are sorted in categories (hulls together, engines together etc.) rather than the more scrambled old version.

* The Tiny Coal Engine received a fuel multiplier buff. It went from 0.5 to 1.5 (compared to the 2.25 of the standard one). This makes the Tiny Coal Engine a viable early game option.

* The Advanced Thermal Engine received a ratio buff for both power/lava and coolant/water. The power/lava ratio used to be 60 and is now 100 (25 for the normal Thermal Engine) and the coolant/water ration was increased from 90 to 150 (the normal Thermal Engine doesn't use coolant). The Advanced Thermal Engine is much more expensive than the normal one and it's an extra step to make sure it also has water, now that water is drained slower and it will generate 4 times as much power as the normal Thermal Engine. 

* The Color Randomizer, the Crafter and the Smelter modules now uses shapeless recipes. Their recipes are otherwise the same. The 3 modules' recipes all have in common that one feature specific item is combined with just a Simple PCB.

* The Advanced Crafter and the Advanced Smelter have both received tweaked recipes. The diamond and Advanced PCB have been replaced with 4 redstone and two simple PCBs. In a raw material cost this reduces the cost with one diamond and three iron ingots. The change was made since the diamond was added purely to make it more expensive, the new recipes makes more sense.

* All tools (drills, farmers and woodcutters) are now indestructible. The durability of the tools have been removed and has at the current stage not been replaced by anything else. However, the drills still have their speed and size difference, the farmers their range difference and the wood cutters their drop chance different that keeps the tiers apart. The change was made since the durability made early game usage very expensive and made the tool carts unreliable.

* The recipe of the Tree: Exotic module was made cheaper. It's now just the disc and the sapling which makes it possible to craft it without visiting the nether. This recipe is like other type upgrades: a disc and a feature specific item on top. It's extra high modular cost remains untouched.

* Upgrades now have dynamic ids. This means that the ids of the upgrades can change between worlds. Upgrades may be registered by other mods without having to bother about any conflicts with other mods.

* The blank upgrade (the base in all tier 1 upgrades) has been made cheaper. It no longer includes any reinforced metals and the Advanced PCB has been replaced by a simple one. All upgrade recipes have also been made cheaper, some just slightly cheaper and some quite drastically. Tier 2 upgrades still requires galgadorian material, but not as much. Control upgrades (redstone, crane, production line etc.) only use very basic components. All these recipe changes have been made to make it worth it to craft and use upgrades, the old recipes were too expensive compared to what they gave the player.

* Fuel cost changes on upgrades are now multiplied with each other rather than added to each other. The standard fuel cost is 1 and with an upgrade increasing it with 3000% (New Era) and one decreasing it with %15 (CO2 friendly) would result in a fuel cost of 2986. However, in the new system the same number would be 2550 (3000 * 0.85). However, due to this change, upgrades with fuel cost change has had their percentages modified. New era now has a 1000% fuel change and CO2 friendly has a 50% one therefore giving a resulting fuel cost of 1*600*0.5 = 300. This change was made to give the CO2 friendly upgrade a better use as well as giving a penalty to stack 6 New Era upgrades (rather than combining them with other upgrades).

* Due to the fuel cost change, both the Experienced Assembler and the New Era upgrades have received efficiency buffs.

* The Entropy assembly time increase for modules have been decreased. This is to make it a more viable option for disassembling carts.

* The negative effects of Module Knowledge and Industrial Espionage have been removed to make them work better with Experienced Assembler and New Era.

* All interfaces' texture sheets have been updated. This is to fix an issue with the extra large interfaces' scaling that causes the rendering to grab a slim slice of colors from a nearby image (in the sheet) and therefore causing weird lines of colors to appear in the interfaces. The updated sheets make sure that there's always at least one pixel between two images in a sheet. Due to this update, any texture packs modifying the interfaces of Steve's Carts 2 won't work in Steve's Vehicles without updating them first.

* The interfaces of the managers (Cargo Manager and Liquid Manager) are now rendered more dynamically, this means that arrows are being rotated on the fly and colors to be applied to the colorless versions in the texture sheet. This means that the colors of the red, blue, yellow, green and black boxes have changed slightly, it's barely noticeable though. Also the button to change the color, due to the more dynamic rendering, reflect which color is currently selected. The currently selected color is the one in the middle and the four colors in the back are those which aren't currently selected.

* The interface of the Liquid Manager have received a small tweak, between the input and output slots there are now a small arrow indicating the movement from input to output. There's also a semi-transparent image of an internal tank in the filter slots. This is to make it easier to think what the arrow directions mean (like it is for the cargo manager).

* The interface of the External Distributors have received some tiny tweaks. The missing icon for the "all" setting has been added and the icons for the manager part and transfer direction settings received some color tweaks.

* The button text and the category titles in the Assembler's interface are now written without pre-made textures. This means that these can now be localized. This change also means their font changed making them look a bit different. The animation for the opening of the slots have been tweaked slightly.

* The amount of storage modules (chests and tanks) a cart can have now depends on the hull. Previously the max was always 4, now it's 2 for wooden hulls, 4 for standard hulls and 6 for reinforced hulls and  better.
